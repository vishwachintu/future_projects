# MedAppeal 
This is an insurance appeal letter generation chat-bot AI powered by Python (Flask) and ReactJS. Developers beware: the code in this repository is of an **astoundingly poor quality**.

## Demo
You can test out a working live demo at [http://medappeal.azurewebsites.net/](http://medappeal.azurewebsites.net/). Note that the demo currently does not work with concurrent requests.

## Motivation
Medical insurance providers often deny claims. 95% of their customers do not appeal. Of those who do, 61% lose. We developed an app that procedurally generates medical appeal letters based on a set of answers recieved from a quick chat with our simple AI.

## Technologies

Built with Python (Flask), Javascript (React), and Bootstrap.
